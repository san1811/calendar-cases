# calendar-BE-cases

Welcome to the calendar-cases repository! This repository serves as a proof of concept for automating Google events FE automation using PlayWright.

## Steps to Execute Test Cases

Follow these steps to execute the test cases:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Before running the test cases, ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can do this by running the following command: => **npm install**

2. **PlayWright plugin**: Install plugin to select and execute cases. Click on testing icon to see test files to execute.

3. **GitHub Actions**: Setup is done but on my local machine, I will keep server on for 2 days so that you can check the flow.
**Cases will get execute on PR raise and master merge**

That's it! You're all set to execute the test cases for the calendar BE automation using Cypress. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, feel free to reach out for assistance. Happy testing!
